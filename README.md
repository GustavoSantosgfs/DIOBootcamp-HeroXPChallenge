# Hero XP Level Classifier

This project was developed as a challenge during the DIO Bootcamp. It classifies a hero based on their experience points (XP) into various levels.

## Challenge Details

Given the amount of XP a hero has, the objective is to classify the hero into one of the following levels:

- XP < 1,000: Ferro
- XP between 1,001 and 2,000: Bronze
- XP between 2,001 and 5,000: Prata
- XP between 5,001 and 7,000: Ouro
- XP between 7,001 and 8,000: Platina
- XP between 8,001 and 9,000: Ascendente
- XP between 9,001 and 10,000: Imortal
- XP ≥ 10,001: Radiante

The output of the program will be:
"O Herói de nome **{nome}** está no nível de **{nivel}**".

## Solution

The solution uses a combination of arrays, loops, and conditionals to determine the level of a hero based on their XP.
